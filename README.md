High-Frequency Amplifier
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our high-frequency amplifier project. The amplifier is specifically tailored for high-frequency operation, making it suitable for various applications in telecommunication, high-speed electronic measurements, laser research, and photonic research.

Project Overview
An amplifier is an electronic device that increases the power of a signal, typically a time-varying voltage or current. Our high-frequency amplifier design meets stringent requirements for bandwidth, low noise, high gain, and noise immunity, ensuring optimal performance. The project emphasizes the use of transistors while strictly avoiding op-amps for the design.

Key Features
Capable of driving a headphone with an 8W load impedance.
Compatible with a 12V power supply.
Amplifies a sine wave with a peak-to-peak voltage of 0.1V.
Works within the frequency range of 20 kHz to 100 kHz, meeting the bandwidth requirement.
Incorporates a minimum of 3 transistors to achieve the desired performance.
